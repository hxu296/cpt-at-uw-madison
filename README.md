 that is required to earn your degree
- Your on-campus course enrollment is for the full duration of the final semester

### **Part-Time versus Full-Time CPT**

Part-time and full-time practical training is defined by immigration as:

- Part-time CPT- 20 hours or less per week
- Full-time CPT- more than 20 hours per week

**Your CPT must be authorized for either part-time or full-time.** If there is a change in the number of hours per week you work that will change your part-time or full-time authorization, you must have new CPT authorization before you change your work schedule. A change in part-time/full-time CPT authorization requires a new CPT application.

### CPT for a job offer outside of Madison

TBD

### CPT Course for L&S students

- Inter LS 260 - Internship in the Liberal Arts and Sciences - 1 credit

### Red**u**ced Course Load

**Exceptions to a full course of study:**

- **Final Semester of Study**
    - If you need less than a full-time course load to complete your program of study in your final semester. (If you are enrolled in summer semester, that is your final semester.)
- **Coursework completed**
    - This option is only available for PhD and Master’s students.
    - You must have completed all coursework and have only your thesis/comprehensive examination (Master’s) or preliminary examination (PhD).

**Three Steps:**

1. Meet with your academic advisor to discuss reason and obtain approval
2. Complete the “Reduced Course Load” request form in TerraDotta. Include your advisor’s email information so they can approve the request.
3. You will get a notification from ISS to your university email address.

**Deadlines:**

- Final Semester of Study - submit before the start date of classes for the semester.
    - Once you have confirmed your enrollment requirements for the upcoming semester, apply for the reduced course load. Enroll in your courses as soon as your enrollment period opens in the preceding semester.
